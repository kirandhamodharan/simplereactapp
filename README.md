A simple template for creating React application with no dependency on any CRA

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.(using webpack-dev-server)<br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
